## Movie Rental Refactoring

A classic refactoring problem from Chapter 1 of
_Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_ by Martin Fowler.  

This repository contains Python code translated from the Java version.

The runnable `main.py` creates a customer and prints a statement.


## Instructions

See [Movie Rental Refactoring, Part 1](https://cpske.github.io/ISP/assignment/movierental/movierental-part1) for description of the code and what to do.

Before and after each refactoring you should **run the unit tests**.

## Resources

See [Resources](https://cpske.github.io/ISP/assignment/movierental/movierental-part1#resources) in the assignment description.


## Rational
2.1 Refactoring sign is Inappropriate Intimacy where one class uses the internal fields of another class.

2.2 The design principle is Single Responsible Principle since the strategy for calculate the price 
and point should be considered in Rental instead of Movie.
